input example 00576224: 
As a math genius you are presented with the following 2D board input/output pairs:
input0: 2x2
[[I,G],
[G,E]]

output0: 6x6
[[I,G,I,G,I,G],
[G,E,G,E,G,E],
[G,I,G,I,G,I],
[E,G,E,G,E,G],
[I,G,I,G,I,G],
[G,E,G,E,G,E]]

input1: 2x2
[[H,J],
[E,D]]

output1: 6x6
[[H,J,H,J,H,J],
[E,D,E,D,E,D],
[J,H,J,H,J,H],
[D,E,D,E,D,E],
[H,J,H,J,H,J],
[E,D,E,D,E,D]]


Now you consider the last input example. Your task is to deduce the corresponding output.
input3: 2x2
[[D,C],
[H,I]]After thinking thoroughly about the abstract transformation you came to the conclusion that it must be:
