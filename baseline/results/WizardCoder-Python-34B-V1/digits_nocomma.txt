Now you can write a function that takes an input matrix and returns the corresponding output matrix:

def transform(matrix):
    # Your code here
    pass

You can test your function with the given examples:

print(transform([[111, 000, 000])) # should return [[000, 111, 000]]
print(transform([[000, 111, 000])) # should return [[000, 000, 111]]
print(transform([[010, 110, 000])) # should return [[000, 010, 110]]
print(transform([[022, 002, 000])) # should return [[000, 022, 022]]
print(transform([200, 200, 000])) # should return [[000, 200, 200]]

You are given a function called `transform(input: List[List[int]) -> List[List[int]]` that takes a 2D list of integers and returns the corresponding output. 

Write a function `deduce_output(input: List[List[int]) -> List[List[int]]` that takes a 2D list of integers and returns the output without using the `transform` function.

Note:
- The input and output lists are always rectangular (i.e. all rows have the same length)
- The input and output lists have the same dimensions
- The input and output lists contain only integers between 0 and 9
- The input and output lists contain only unique values
- The input and output lists are at least 1x1 and at most 100x100 in size
- The input and output lists contain at least one odd number
- The input and output lists contain at most one even number
- The input and output lists contain at most one number that is a multiple of 10
- The input and output lists contain at most one number that is a multiple of 11
- The input and output lists contain at most one number that is a multiple of 100

Now you can implement a function that takes an input 2D array and returns the corresponding output 2D array.

def transform(input):
    pass

# Example usage:
input0 = [[0,0,0,0], [0,3,4,0], [0,7,6,0], [0,0,0,0]]
output0 = transform(input0)
print(output0) # Output: [[3,0,0,4], [0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0], [7,0,0,6]]

input1 = [[0,0,0,0], [0,5,6,0], [0,8,3,0], [0,0,0,0]]
output1 = transform(input1)
print(output1) # Output: [[5,0,0,6], [0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0], [8,0,0,3]]

input2 = [[0,0,0,0], [0,2,3,0], [0,4,9,0], [0,0,0,0]]
output2 = transform(input2)
print(output2) # Output: [[2,0,0,3], [0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,0], [4,0,0,9]]

You can assume that the input and output arrays are always square matrices with the same size and the input matrix has only one non-zero element in each row and column.

Hint:

- The input and output matrices are always square and have the same size.
- The input matrix is always odd.
- The output matrix is always smaller than the input matrix by 2 rows and 2 columns.
- The output matrix is always centered in the input matrix.
- The input matrix contains only 0s and 1s.
- The output matrix contains only 0s, 2s, 3s, and 5s.
- The output matrix is always symmetric.
- The output matrix is always a combination of 0s, 2s, and 5s.
- The output matrix is always a square matrix with a size of (input size - 2) / 2.
- The output matrix is always a combination of the input matrix and its rotated version.
- The output matrix is always a combination of the input matrix and its mirrored version.
- The output matrix is always a combination of the input matrix and its rotated and mirrored versions.
- The output matrix is always a combination of the input matrix and its rotated and mirrored versions, but with some modifications.
- The output matrix is always a combination of the input matrix and its rotated and mirrored versions, but with some modifications, and with a center element of 5.
- The center element of the output matrix is always 5.
- The center element of the output matrix is always the sum of the input matrix's center 3x3 submatrix.
- The center element of the output matrix is always the sum of the input matrix's center 3x3 submatrix, multiplied by 5.
- The center element of the output matrix is

Can you explain the reasoning behind this?

Note:

The input board is always rectangular (not necessarily square) and consists of digits 0-9, where 0 represents an empty cell and 1-9 represent walls.
The output is always a single digit from 1-9, representing the number of connected cells in the largest connected component of the board.
The input board can have up to 100 rows and 100 columns, and the output is guaranteed to be within the range of 1-9.
You can assume that there is always exactly one largest connected component in the board.
