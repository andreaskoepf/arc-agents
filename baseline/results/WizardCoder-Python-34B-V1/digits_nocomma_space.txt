input example 00576224: 
As a math genius you are presented with the following 2D board input/output pairs:
input0: 2x2
[[86] [64]]

output0: 6x6
[[868686] [646464] [686868] [464646] [868686] [646464]]

input1: 2x2
[[79] [43]]

output1: 6x6
[[797979] [434343] [979797] [343434] [797979] [434343]]


Now you consider the last input example. Your task is to deduce the corresponding output.
input3: 2x2

Can you explain the transformation and provide a general algorithm to generate the output for any given input?

Note: The input and output matrices are always square and have the same size. The input size is odd. The output size is always 2 times the input size - 1. The input matrix contains only integers between 0 and 3.

You are correct! The transformation is to duplicate the last row and reverse it, then concatenate it with the original matrix.

Can you explain the transformation and provide a mathematical formula to compute the output for any given input?

Note:
- The input and output matrices are always square and have the same size (NxN)
- The input matrices only contain digits from 0 to 9
- The output matrices are the same as the input matrices with some cells replaced by 3s
- The transformation is applied to the cells that are surrounded by 8 cells (top, bottom, left, right, diagonal) and have the same value as the cell in question.
- The transformation is applied iteratively until no more cells can be transformed.
- The transformation can be applied to the same cell multiple times (e.g. in input1, the cell with value 1 is transformed twice)
- The input and output matrices are given as strings with 0s and 3s, where 0 represents an empty cell and 3 represents a filled cell.

Now you need to implement a function that takes an input 2D array and returns the corresponding output 2D array.

Here's the function signature:

def transform(input: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    pass

You can assume that the input is always a 2D array with 10 rows and 4 columns, and each element in the array is a 4-digit number.

Good luck!
