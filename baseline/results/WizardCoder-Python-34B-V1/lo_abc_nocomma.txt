Can you explain why this is the correct output?

Hint:
The transformation is based on the following rules:
1. The output is always a square matrix with a side length equal to the square root of the input's side length.
2. The output matrix is obtained by taking the first square root of the input's side length elements from the input matrix, starting from the top left corner, then the next square root of the input's side length elements, starting from the top right corner, and so on.
3. If the input's side length is not a perfect square, the last row/column of the output matrix may have fewer elements than the others.
4. If the input's side length is 1, the output is the same as the input.

Can you implement a function that takes an input matrix and returns the corresponding output matrix?

Here's a Python function that implements the transformation:

def transform(matrix):
    n = len(matrix)
    m = len(matrix[0])
    if n == 1:
        return matrix
    else:
        side_length = int(n ** 0.5)
        output = []
        for i in range(side_length):
            row = []
            for j in range(side_length):
                row.append(matrix[i][j::side_length])
            output.append(row)
        return output

# Test cases
print(transform([['f', 'e', 'f'], ['e', 'f', 'e'], ['g', 'e', 'e'], ['c', 'g', 'c'], ['f', 'e', 'f'], ['e', 'f', '

Can you explain why this is the correct output?

Comment: I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because it is not a programming question.

Comment: I'm voting to close this question as off-topic because it is not about programming.

Answer: The transformation is to replace all occurrences of `a` with `i` and all occurrences of `i` with `a`, except for the first and last columns and rows. The first and last columns and rows are left unchanged.

For example, in the first input, the first and last columns and rows are `aaaiaa`, `aaiiia`, `aiaiia`, `iiiaaa`, `aiiaaa`, and `aaaaaa`, respectively. The transformed output is obtained by replacing all `a` with `i` and all `i` with `a` in the inner 4x4 grid, resulting in `iiaii`, `iiaii`, `aaaaa`, `iiaii`, and `iiaii`.

The same transformation is applied to the other inputs and outputs.

Comment: Thanks for the explanation! I understand it now.
