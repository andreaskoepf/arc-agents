The transformation is a repetitive pattern that expands the input matrix horizontally and vertically. The values in the output matrix are taken from the input matrix and repeated in a specific pattern.

To come up with the answer, I first observed the pattern in the input/output pairs provided. I noticed that the output matrix is always a 6x6 matrix, and the values in the output matrix are taken from the input matrix and repeated in a specific pattern.

Based on this observation, I deduced that the transformation must be a repetitive pattern that expands the input matrix horizontally and vertically. I then applied this pattern to the last input example and came up with the corresponding output matrix.

The transformation is a bitwise XOR operation on the corresponding elements of the input matrix and the identity matrix of the same size. The identity matrix is a square matrix in which all the elements of the main diagonal are 1 and all other elements are 0. For example, for a 3x3 input matrix, the identity matrix would be:

[[1,0,0],
[0,1,0],
[0,0,1]]

The bitwise XOR operation is performed element-wise on the input matrix and the identity matrix. The result is a new matrix with the same dimensions as the input matrix. For example, for the first input matrix:

input0: 3x3
[[5,5,0],
[5,0,5],
[0,5,0]]

The corresponding identity matrix is:

identity0: 3x3
[[1,0,0],
[0,1,0],
[0,0,1]]

The bitwise XOR operation on the corresponding elements of input0 and identity0 yields:

output0: 3x3
[[6,5,0],
[5,1,5],
[0,5,0]]

The transformation then takes the first element of the resulting matrix and returns it as the output. In this case, the output is:

output0: 1x1
[[6]]

Using this transformation, we can deduce the output for the last input example as follows:

input8: 3x3
[[0,8,0],
[8,8,8],
[0,8,0]]

The corresponding identity matrix is:

identity8: 3x3
[[1,0,0],
[0

The transformation is a sliding window that takes a 5x5 submatrix from the input matrix and returns it as the output matrix. The window slides over the input matrix, taking a new 5x5 submatrix each time and returning it as the output.

To come up with this answer, I looked at the input and output matrices for the previous examples and noticed a pattern. In each case, the output matrix was a smaller square matrix that was obtained by taking a submatrix of the same size from the input matrix. I then tried to apply this pattern to the last input matrix and came up with the corresponding output matrix.

The transformation seems to be:

1. Swap the values of the two elements in the bottom-right corner.
2. Swap the values of the two elements in the top-left corner.
3. Swap the values of the two elements in the bottom-left corner.

The transformation seems to be a bitwise XOR operation between all elements in the matrix.

For example, in the first input, the XOR of all elements in the first row is 2 ^ 0 ^ 2 = 2, and the XOR of all elements in the second row is 0 ^ 2 ^ 0 = 2, and so on. The XOR of all elements in the matrix is 2 ^ 0 ^ 2 ^ 0 ^ 2 = 1, which is the output.

In the last input, the XOR of all elements in the first row is 2 ^ 0 ^ 2 = 2, and the XOR of all elements in the second row is 2 ^ 2 ^ 2 = 2, and so on. The XOR of all elements in the matrix is 2 ^ 2 ^ 2 ^ 0 ^ 2 = 1, which is the output.

Therefore, the transformation is a bitwise XOR operation between all elements in the matrix.

The transformation seems to be a simple one:

1. Read the input board row-wise.
2. For each row, find the minimum and maximum values.
3. Subtract the minimum from the maximum and store the result in a new list.
4. Repeat steps 2-3 for all rows.
5. Concatenate the resulting lists into a single list.

In this case, the minimum values are always 1 and the maximum values are always 8, so the output is simply [7,7,7,7].

However, this transformation does not seem to work for the first three input/output pairs. For example, for input0, the minimum values are not always 1 and the maximum values are not always 8. Therefore, I am unable to deduce the corresponding output for input4 based on the given examples.

The transformation is a reflection across the vertical axis followed by a reflection across the horizontal axis.

The first reflection across the vertical axis is given by:

def reflect_vertically(board):
    n = len(board)
    m = len(board[0])
    reflected = [[0 for _ in range(m)] for _ in range(n)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            reflected[i][j] = board[i][m-j-1]
    return reflected

The second reflection across the horizontal axis is given by:

def reflect_horizontally(board):
    n = len(board)
    m = len(board[0])
    reflected = [[0 for _ in range(m)] for _ in range(n)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            reflected[i][j] = board[n-i-1][j]
    return reflected

Combining the two reflections gives the final transformation:

def transform(board):
    return reflect_horizontally(reflect_vertically(board))

This transformation can be applied to any 2D board of integers to obtain the corresponding output.

You are correct! The transformation is a 3x3 sliding window that moves from left to right and from top to bottom. The window selects the center element of the 3x3 input submatrix and places it in the corresponding position in the output matrix. The window then slides one position to the right and repeats the process until it reaches the end of the input matrix. Finally, the window slides one position down and repeats the process until it reaches the bottom of the input matrix.

In the case of input5, the transformation works as follows:

1. The window starts at the top left corner of the input matrix and selects the center element, which is 4. It places this element in the top left corner of the output matrix.
2. The window slides one position to the right and selects the center element, which is 4. It places this element in the top center position of the output matrix.
3. The window slides one position to the right again and selects the center element, which is 4. It places this element in the top right position of the output matrix.
4. The window slides one position down and selects the center element, which is 3. It places this element in the center left position of the output matrix.
5. The window slides one position to the right and selects the center element, which is 3. It places this element in the center position of the output matrix.
6. The window slides one position to the right again and selects the center element, which is 2. It places this element in the center right position of the output matrix.
7. The window slides one position down and selects the center element, which is 1. It places this element in the bottom

The transformation is a cyclic shift of the elements in each row to the right.

I used the definition of a cyclic shift, which is a transformation that moves each element in a sequence to the right by a certain number of positions. In this case, the number of positions is equal to the length of the sequence minus one.

For example, in the first row of input0, the elements are [0, 3, 4, 0]. After a cyclic shift to the right, the elements become [3, 4, 0, 0]. This is the same as the first row of output0, which is [3, 0, 0, 4].

I applied this same transformation to each row of input3 to get the corresponding output3.

You are correct! The transformation is a simple extension of the original 3x3 grid to a 3x6 grid by repeating the elements in the original grid.

The transformation works by taking each element in the original 3x3 grid and repeating it twice in the corresponding position in the extended 3x6 grid. For example, in the first row of the input grid, the elements are 6, 8, and 6. In the corresponding row of the output grid, these elements are repeated twice to give 6, 8, 6, 6, 8, and 6.

The same pattern is followed for the other rows in the input grid, resulting in the final output grid of 3x6 with the elements repeated twice in each row.

Well done for figuring out the pattern!

You have successfully deduced the corresponding output for the last input example.

The pattern in the given input/output pairs is that all elements in the first row and first column of the input matrix are set to 8 in the output matrix. The remaining elements in the output matrix are set to 0.

In the last input example (input5: 7x6), we can apply the same pattern to deduce the corresponding output matrix (output5: 7x6). The first row and first column of the input matrix are set to 8 in the output matrix, and the remaining elements are set to 0.

Therefore, the output for input5: 7x6 is:

output5: 7x6

The transformation seems to be duplicating the rows of the input matrix.

I used the definition of the transformation by observing the input/output pairs and noticing that the output matrix has twice as many rows as the input matrix, and that each row in the output matrix is a duplicate of the corresponding row in the input matrix. Based on this observation, I deduced that the corresponding output for the last input example would be obtained by duplicating the rows of the input matrix.

The transformation seems to be cropping the input matrix to the smallest possible multiple of 4x4 submatrices.

For example, in the first input, the smallest possible multiple of 4x4 submatrices is 4x8, so the output is 4x4. In the second input, the smallest possible multiple of 4x4 submatrices is 3x6, so the output is 3x3. In the third input, the smallest possible multiple of 4x4 submatrices is 3x2, so the output is 3x2.

In the last input, the smallest possible multiple of 4x4 submatrices is 4x3, so the output is 4x3.

The transformation appears to be a reduction of the input matrix to a 2x2 matrix by taking the average of the corresponding elements in the input matrix.

For example, in the first input/output pair:

input0: 9x9
[[0,0,2,0,0,0,4,0,0],
[0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0],
[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],

[0,0,2,0,0,0,4,0,0],
[0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0],
[0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0]]

output0: 2x2
[[4,4],
[4,4]]

The corresponding elements in the input matrix are averaged to get the elements in the output matrix:

(0+0+2+0+0+4+0+0)/8 = 4
(0+0+0+0+0+0+4+0)/8 = 4

Therefore, the output matrix is [[4,4],[4,4]].

The same transformation is applied to the other input/output pairs, resulting in the output matrix being [[2,2],[2,2]] for input1 and input2, and [[2,2],[2

The transformation is quite simple. It duplicates each row and then adds two rows of zeros at the bottom.

Let's call the input matrix A and the output matrix B. Then the transformation can be expressed as:

B = [A, 0, 0]

where 0 is a 3x3 matrix of zeros.

The transformation appears to be a reduction of the size of the matrix by a factor of 2.5 (7x7 to 3x3). The new matrix is filled with the values of the original matrix in a way that maintains the row-wise and column-wise maxima.

For example, in the first input/output pair:

input0: 7x7
[[0,4,1,0,0,1,6],
[0,0,1,0,0,0,0],
[1,1,0,0,1,1,0],

[1,1,1,0,4,1,0]]

output0: 3x3
[[0,0,8],
[8,8,0],

The maximum values in each row of the input matrix are [4, 1, 6], [0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0], [0, 1, 7], [0, 2, 0], [1, 1, 7], and [1, 4, 0]. These values are placed in the corresponding rows of the output matrix. Similarly, the maximum values in each column of the input matrix are [4, 1, 6, 0, 1, 7, 6], [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 2, 0

[0,5,6,0,0,5,6,0],
[6,6,1,0,6,6,1,0],
[0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1]]

The transformation seems to be padding the input matrix with the values of the adjacent matrix in a checkerboard pattern.

For example, in the first input, the 3x3 matrix is padded with the values of the adjacent 3x6 matrix in a checkerboard pattern:

input0: 3x3
[[0,5,0],
[5,5,2],
[0,0,0]]

adjacent: 3x6
[[0,5,0,0,5,0],
[5,5,2,5,5,2],
[0,0,0,0,0,0]]

output0: 3x6
[[0,5,0,0,5,0],
[5,5,2,5,5,2],
[0,0,0,0,0,0]]

Similarly, for the second and third inputs, the 4x3 and 4x4 matrices are padded with the values of the adjacent 4x6 and 4x8 matrices, respectively, in a checkerboard pattern:

input1: 4x3
[[3,0,0],
[2,3,0],
[2,1,8],
[0,1,0]]

adjacent: 4x6
[[3,0,0
expected: 5x8
[[4,0,0,0,4,0,0,0],
[4,5,0,0,4,5,0,0],
[0,5,6,0,0,5,6,0],
[6,6,1,0,6,6,1,0],
[0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1]]

[8,8,0,8,8]]

You are correct! The transformation is a sliding window that moves across the input board, taking a 5x5 submatrix and outputting it to the corresponding position on the output board. The window starts at the top-left corner of the input board and moves right, then down, then left, then up, repeating this pattern until it reaches the bottom-right corner. The input board is padded with zeros on the left, top, and right sides to ensure that the window always has 5x5 submatrices to work with.

Well done! You have successfully deduced the transformation and solved the puzzle.
