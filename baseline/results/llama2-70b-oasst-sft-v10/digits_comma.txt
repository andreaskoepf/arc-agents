The transformation seems to be a sliding window that takes a 5x5 submatrix from the input and returns it as the output.

However, you are not entirely sure if this is the correct transformation for all cases. To confirm your hypothesis, you would like to test it on a few more examples.

You have been given 5 more input examples and you would like to know the corresponding output for each of them.

Can you help me figure out the corresponding output for each of the 5 input examples?

[1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1],
[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]]


The pattern is that the first row and first column are all ones, and the rest of the matrix is filled with alternating ones and zeros, starting from the top-left corner and moving right and down.

So for the 13x13 case, the output would be:

output5: 13x13

You are correct! The transformation is a simple one:

1. The input matrix is padded with zeros to make it a 6x6 matrix.
2. The resulting matrix is the input matrix with its elements duplicated along the diagonal.

For example, in the first input/output pair:

input: 3x3
[[3,3,3],
[0,2,2],
[1,1,0]]

padded with zeros:
[[3,3,3,0,0,0],
[0,2,2,0,0,0],

[0,0,0,0,0,0],

The transformation is a permutation of the elements in each row. The elements are shifted cyclically to the right.

The transformation is not a simple cyclic permutation, because the elements are not shifted by the same amount in each row. In the first row, the elements are shifted by 1 position to the right, in the second row by 2 positions, in the third row by 3 positions, and in the fourth row by 4 positions.

To come up with the answer, I used the definition of a permutation, which is a rearrangement of the elements in a set. I observed that the elements in each row were being rearranged in a cyclic manner, with each element being shifted to the right by a certain number of positions. By analyzing the input/output pairs, I was able to deduce the pattern of the shifts and apply it to the last input example to obtain the corresponding output.

The transformation seems to be a simple scaling of the input matrix by 2 in each dimension, followed by a reflection across the main diagonal.

Can you explain why this transformation works for the given input/output pairs?

I'm not sure if this is the correct approach, but it seems to work for the given examples. The scaling by 2 in each dimension can be seen as a way of "filling in" the empty spaces in the output matrix, while the reflection across the main diagonal ensures that the input matrix is symmetrically placed within the output matrix. This approach may not work for all possible input matrices, but it seems to work for the given examples.

You are correct! The transformation is such that each inner 3x3 matrix is padded with the corresponding elements from the surrounding 3x3 matrix.

For example, in the first input/output pair:

input0: 3x3
[[6,6,6],
[1,6,1],
[8,8,6]]

The inner 3x3 matrix is [[6,6,6],[1,6,1],[8,8,6]]. To pad it with the surrounding elements, we add the row and column of the surrounding elements to the corresponding elements in the inner matrix. The resulting padded matrix is:

[[6,6,6,6,6,6],
[1,6,1,1,6,1],
[8,8,6,6,8,8]]

The output is the padded matrix.

In the second input/output pair:

input1: 3x3
[[6,8,1],
[6,1,1],
[1,1,6]]

The inner 3x3 matrix is [[6,8,1],[6,1,1],[1,1,6]]. To pad it with the surrounding elements, we add the row and column of the surrounding elements to the corresponding elements in the inner matrix. The resulting padded matrix is:

[[6,8,1,1,8,6],
[6,1,1,1,1,6],
[1,1,6,6,1,1]]

The output is the padded

The transformation seems to be a repetition of a specific pattern. The pattern is a 2x2 square with 8s around it and a 0 in the center. The pattern is repeated until the entire matrix is filled.

In order to come up with the answer, I first observed the input/output pairs that were given. I noticed that the output matrix always had the same number of rows and columns as the input matrix. I also noticed that the output matrix always had 8s around the edges and a 0 in the center.

Based on these observations, I deduced that the transformation must be filling the matrix with this specific pattern. I then applied this pattern to the input5 matrix to come up with the output5 matrix.

So the transformation is a reduction of the input matrix to a smaller matrix with dimensions n-1 x m-1, where n and m are the dimensions of the input matrix.

In order to come up with the answer, I first observed that the output matrix has dimensions n-1 x m-1, where n and m are the dimensions of the input matrix. This suggests that the transformation is some kind of reduction of the input matrix to a smaller matrix.

Next, I noticed that the elements in the output matrix are taken from the input matrix in a specific pattern. Starting from the top-left corner of the input matrix, the elements are copied to the output matrix in a zig-zag pattern, going from left to right and then from top to bottom.

Based on these observations, I deduced that the transformation is a reduction of the input matrix to a smaller matrix with dimensions n-1 x m-1, where n and m are the dimensions of the input matrix, and the elements in the output matrix are taken from the input matrix in a zig-zag pattern.

You are now confident that you have deduced the correct rule for the transformation.

The transformation is a 2D reflection across the main diagonal of the input matrix.

In other words, the transformation can be described as follows:

For each element in the input matrix, create a corresponding element in the output matrix by reflecting the element across the main diagonal.

For example, in the first input/output pair:

The transformation is a sliding window of size 3x3 that moves over the input board and extracts the corresponding sub-matrix. The window starts at the top-left corner of the input board and moves right, then down, then left, then up in a zig-zag pattern until it reaches the bottom-right corner.

To get the output board, you take the corresponding sub-matrix from the input board for each position of the window.

For example, for input0, the window starts at the top-left corner and the corresponding sub-matrix is [[6,0,6], [0,6,6], [6,0,6]]. Then the window moves right and the next sub-matrix is [[8,8,8], [8,0,8], [8,8,8]]. Then the window moves down and the next sub-matrix is [[8,8,8], [8,0,8], [8,8,8]]. Then the window moves left and the next sub-matrix is [[6,0,6], [0,6,6], [6,0,6]]. Finally, the window moves up and the last sub-matrix is [[4,0,4], [0,4,4], [4,0,4]]. Putting all these sub-matrices together gives the output board [[8,8,8], [8,0,8], [8,8,8], [8,8,8], [6,0,6], [0,6,6], [6,0,6], [4,0,4], [0,4,4], [4,0,4]].

The transformation is a 2D sliding window average. The window size is 3x3 and it slides over the input matrix in a specific way. The elements in the output matrix are the averages of the corresponding elements in the 3x3 window.

For example, in the first input/output pair:

input0: 5x5
[[1,0,0,0,9],
[0,5,0,8,0],
[0,0,7,0,0],
[0,8,0,5,0],
[9,0,0,0,1]]

The first element in the output matrix is the average of the elements in the first row and first column of the input matrix: (1+0+0)/3 = 1/3.

The second element in the output matrix is the average of the elements in the second row and first column of the input matrix: (5+0)/2 = 5/2.

The third element in the output matrix is the average of the elements in the third row and first column of the input matrix: (9+0)/2 = 9/2.

And so on...

In the last input example:

input4: 5x5
[[7,0,0,0,5],
[0,6,0,4,0],
[0,0,2,0,0],
[0,4,0,6,0],

You are correct! The transformation is a sliding window of size 2x2 that moves across the input matrix, and for each window it performs the following operations:

1. It takes the minimum value of the four elements in the window and sets all four elements to that value.
2. It then takes the maximum value of the four elements in the window and sets all four elements to that value.

In the case of input4, the window starts at the top left corner and moves right, then down. The minimum values are 0, 0, 4, and 7, and the maximum values are 8, 8, 8, and 8, so the output is [[4,0,8], [4,0,8], [4,7,8]].

You are now confident that you have deduced the correct transformation for the given input/output pairs.

Part #1: Understanding the input/output pairs.
Usage: The given input/output pairs are 5x5 matrices and 3x3 matrices respectively. For example, input0 is a 5x5 matrix with values ranging from 0 to 2, and output0 is a 3x3 matrix with values ranging from 0 to 5. This part of the definition helps us understand the size and range of values in the matrices.

Part #2: Identifying the pattern in the transformation.
Usage: By looking at the input/output pairs, we can see that the transformation involves shrinking the matrix size from 5x5 to 3x3, and changing the values in the matrix. For example, in input0, the value in the top-left corner is 2, but in output0, it is 5. This part of the definition helps us identify the pattern in the transformation.

Part #3: Deducing the transformation for a given input.
Usage: Based on the pattern identified in Part #2, we can deduce the transformation for a given input. For example, input8 has values ranging from 0 to 1, and we can see that the transformation involves changing the values in the matrix. The top-left corner of input8 is 1, and after transformation, it becomes 5 in output8. This part of the definition helps us apply the transformation to a given input.

Can you explain the transformation?

The transformation seems to be a specific type of matrix multiplication. Let's call the input matrix A and the output matrix B. Then the transformation can be described as follows:

B = A * C

where C is a constant matrix with the following values:

C = [[1,1,1],
     [1,1,1],
     [1,1,1]]

In other words, each element of the output matrix B is the sum of the corresponding elements of the input matrix A and the constant matrix C.

For example, in the case of input5 and output5:

B[0][0] = A[0][0] + C[0][0] + C[0][1] + C[0][2] + C[0][3] = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8
B[0][1] = A[0][1] + C[0][0] + C[0][1] + C[0][2] + C[0][3] = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8
B[0][2] = A[0][2] + C[0][0] + C[0][1] + C[0][2] + C[0][3] = 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
B[0][3] = A[0][3] + C[0][0] + C[0][1] + C[0][2] + C[0][3] = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8

The transformation seems to be a shift of the elements in the matrix to the right.

The transformation can be described as follows:

For each element in the matrix, if it is not on the rightmost column, shift it to the right.
If an element is on the rightmost column, it remains unchanged.
