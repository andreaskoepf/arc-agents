The transformation is not a simple rotation, reflection, or translation. It is not a simple scaling or shearing transformation either. It is not a combination of these transformations. It is not a transformation that can be described by a matrix. It is not a transformation that can be described by a set of rules. It is not a transformation that can be described by a computer program. It is not a transformation that can be described by a human. It is not a transformation that can be described at all. It is a completely random and unpredictable transformation. It is a transformation that can only be discovered by trial and error. It is a transformation that can only be understood by intuition. It is a transformation that can only be described by a math genius.

You are now confident that you have deduced the correct transformation for the given input/output pairs.

Part #1: Identify the input board size.
Usage: For example, in input0, the board size is 7x7. This means that the input board will have 7 rows and 7 columns.

Part #2: Identify the output board size.
Usage: For example, in output0, the board size is 3x3. This means that the output board will have 3 rows and 3 columns.

Part #3: Extract the corresponding cells from the input board.
Usage: For example, in input0, the cells in the top-left 3x3 corner are [χχαδααδ], [χχαχχαα], and [αααχχαα]. These cells will be used to create the output board.

Part #4: Transform the extracted cells according to the given rules.
Usage: In our example, the transformation rule is to replace each cell with its corresponding Greek letter: χ -> β, α -> α, and δ -> δ. So the transformed cells are [ββδδδ], [βββββ], and [αααδδα].

Part #5: Create the output board using the transformed cells.
Usage: For example, in output0, the top-left 3x3 corner is [ββδδδ], [βββββ], and [αααδδα]. These cells form the output board.

Part #6: Repeat the process for all input/output pairs.
Usage: For example, for input1, the transformed cells are [βαα
expected: 3x3

The transformation is a simple one. It takes the center 2x2 submatrix of the input matrix and returns it as the output.

For example, in the first input, the center 2x2 submatrix is [[αψψψψα], [αψααψααα]]. The corresponding output is [[ιι], [ιι]].

In the second input, the center 2x2 submatrix is [[γγγγγα], [γαααγααα]]. The corresponding output is [[ψψ], [ψψ]].

In the third input, the center 2x2 submatrix is [[αεεεεεα], [αεααααεα]]. The corresponding output is [[εε], [εε]].

In the fourth input, the center 2x2 submatrix is [[δδδδδα], [δαααδαδα]]. The corresponding output is [[δδ], [δδ]].

Therefore, the transformation is simply taking the center 2x2 submatrix of the input matrix and returning it as the output.

You are now confident that you have deduced the correct transformation for the 2D board. The transformation seems to be a compression of the original board, where the top-left 3x3 submatrix of the output corresponds to the top-left 3x3 submatrix of the input, the middle 3x3 submatrix of the output corresponds to the middle 3x3 submatrix of the input, and the bottom-right 3x3 submatrix of the output corresponds to the bottom-right 3x3 submatrix of the input.

The transformation seems to be a simple translation of the Greek letters. The first letter of the alphabet is translated to the first letter of the English alphabet, the second letter of the Greek alphabet is translated to the second letter of the English alphabet, and so on.

The transformation seems to be a repetitive process that duplicates each row and then adds the duplicated rows to the bottom of the matrix.

So, for a 3x3 input matrix, the output matrix will be 6x3.

For a 4x3 input matrix, the output matrix will be 8x3 (duplicate each row and then add the duplicated rows to the bottom).

For a 5x3 input matrix, the output matrix will be 10x3 (duplicate each row and then add the duplicated rows to the bottom).

In general, for an nx3 input matrix, the output matrix will be 2nx3 (duplicate each row and then add the duplicated rows to the bottom).

Therefore, for an nxm input matrix, the output matrix will be 2nxm.

Can you explain how you arrived at this conclusion?

The transformation is a reduction of the size of the board from 7x7 to 3x3. To achieve this, we can take the central 3x3 submatrix of the original 7x7 matrix. This is because the central 3x3 submatrix will always contain all the distinct elements of the original matrix, and thus we can use it to represent the original matrix in a smaller size.

For example, in the first input/output pair:

input0: 7x7
[[αεβααβγ],
[ααβαααα],
[ββααββα],
[αβαααββ],
[ααβααχα],
[βαβαβαψ],
[βββαεβα]]

output0: 3x3
[[ααι],
[ιια],
[αια]]

The central 3x3 submatrix of input0 is:

[[ααβααβγ],
[ααβαααα],
[ββααββα]]

Taking the central 3x3 submatrix gives us the output0:

[[ααι],
[ιια],
[αια]]

We can see that this transformation preserves the distinct elements of the original matrix, and thus we can use it to represent the original matrix in a smaller size.

You are now confident that you have deduced the correct transformation for the given input/output pairs.

The transformation is as follows:

1. Take the 6x6 input board.
2. Create a 5x5 output board with all cells initialized to 0.
3. Iterate over each row of the input board, starting from the top-left corner.
4. For each row, copy the first 5 cells to the corresponding cells in the output board.
5. If there are any remaining cells in the row, set them to 0.
6. Repeat steps 3-5 for each row of the input board.
7. Return the output board.

Using this transformation, you can generate the output board for any given 6x6 input board.

The transformation is a 2x2 sliding window that moves from left to right and from top to bottom. The elements in the window are concatenated in a row-major order to form a 2x2 matrix.

For example, in the first input, the window starts at the top-left corner and moves right, then down, resulting in the 2x2 matrix [εδ, γα]. The same process is repeated for the other inputs.

Therefore, the corresponding output for the last input is [[δγ], [χδ]].

You are now confident that you have deduced the correct transformation for the 2D board.

Part #1: Understanding the input and output boards.
Usage: The input board is a 5x5 grid of characters, and the output board is a 3x3 grid of characters. The task is to transform the input board into the output board. For example, in input0, the input board is [[χαααα], [αχααχ], [χααχα], [αααχχ], [ααχχα]], and the output board is [[φφφ], [αφα], [αφα]]. This means that we need to transform the input board into the output board.

Part #2: Identifying the transformation pattern.
Usage: By looking at the input/output pairs, we can see that the transformation pattern is to take the central 3x3 submatrix of the input board and copy it to the output board. For example, in input0, the central 3x3 submatrix is [[αχα], [ααα], [αφα]], and the output board is [[φφφ], [αφα], [αφα]]. This means that the transformation pattern is to copy the central 3x3 submatrix of the input board to the output board.

Part #3: Applying the transformation pattern to the last input example.
Usage: In input8, the central 3x3 submatrix is [[αβα], [ααβ], [αβα]]. By copying this submatrix to the output board, we get the output board [[αφα], [φφφ], [αφα]]. This means that the transformation of

SOLUTION found for d631b094 at index 0.
output: 1x5
[[εεεεε]]


The transformation is a sliding window that shifts one position to the right on each iteration. The window size is always 1x2. The elements of the window are considered and the result is the elements of the window in reverse order.

In the first iteration, the window is at position (0,0), and contains elements [εεα]. The result is [αεε].
In the second iteration, the window is at position (0,1), and contains elements [εαε]. The result is [εεε].
In the third iteration, the window is at position (0,2), and contains elements [ααε]. The result is [εεεε].

Therefore, the output for input5: 3x3
[[εεα],
[εαε],
[ααε]] is output5: 1x5
[[εεεεε]].

The transformation seems to be a sliding window of size 3x3 that moves over the input board, and for each window it replaces the center element with the average of the 9 elements in the window.

For example, in the first input/output pair:
input: 3x3
[[δαα],
[ααα],
[ααε]]

output: 3x3
[[ααα],
[αδα],
[ααε]]

The window moves over the input board as follows:

1. Window: [[δαα], [ααα], [ααε]]
   Average: (δ+α+α)/3 = α
   Output: [[α], [αδ], [αε]]

2. Window: [[ααα], [αδα], [ααε]]
   Average: (α+α+δ)/3 = α
   Output: [[α], [αα], [αε]]
