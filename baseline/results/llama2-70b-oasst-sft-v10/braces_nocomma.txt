output: 1x1
[[]]]

The transformation is a mapping from a 3x3 input grid to a 1x1 output grid. The transformation appears to be based on the number of opening and closing parentheses in the input grid.

To determine the output grid, we can count the number of opening and closing parentheses in the input grid and use that to construct the output grid.

For example, in input0, there are 3 opening parentheses and 3 closing parentheses, so the output grid is [[]].

In input1, there are 4 opening parentheses and 1 closing parenthesis, so the output grid is [[>]].

In input2, there are 3 opening parentheses and 3 closing parentheses, so the output grid is [[]].

In input3, there are 4 opening parentheses and 1 closing parenthesis, so the output grid is [[]].

In input4, there are 2 opening parentheses and 2 closing parentheses, so the output grid is [[>]].

In input5, there are 2 opening parentheses and 2 closing parentheses, so the output grid is [[>]].

Based on this pattern, we can deduce that the output for input7 should be [[]], since there are 3 opening parentheses and 3 closing parentheses in the input grid.

The transformation is a sliding window that expands the input matrix horizontally and vertically by a factor of 2. The expansion is filled with the corresponding mirrored values from the input matrix.

For example, in the first input/output pair:

input: 3x4

[}}##],
[#}##]]

expanded input: 6x8
[[##}#],
[}}##],
[#}##],
[##}#],

You are correct! The transformation is indeed a depth-first search (DFS) traversal of the input tree, where the output tree is constructed by mirroring the input tree at each node. This is known as the "mirror reflection" transformation.

Well done! You have successfully deduced the corresponding output for the given input.

The transformation is a reduction of the board size from 6x6 to 5x5. The algorithm is as follows:

1. Read the input board as a 2D array of characters.
2. Create an empty output board as a 2D array of characters with dimensions 5x5.
3. Iterate over each row of the input board from top to bottom.
4. For each row, iterate over each column from left to right.
5. If the current cell in the input board is not empty, copy its value to the corresponding cell in the output board.
6. After iterating over all cells in the input board, return the output board.

The algorithm reduces the size of the board by removing the outer row and column of cells. It then copies over the inner 5x5 region of cells from the input board to the output board. This results in an output board with dimensions 5x5.

The algorithm preserves the relative positions of non-empty cells in the output board, and only removes empty cells in the outer row and column. This results in a visually similar board with a smaller size.

The algorithm is deterministic and produces the same output for a given input. It does not rely on any randomness or external input.

The time complexity of the algorithm is O(30), where 30 is the number of cells in the input board. This is because the algorithm iterates over each cell in the input board exactly once. The space complexity of the algorithm is O(25), where 25 is the number of cells in the output board. This is because the algorithm creates a new output board with dimensions 5x5 to store the result.

The transformation is a simple one-to-one mapping of the input to the output, where each element in the input is copied to the corresponding position in the output.

The transformation can be described as follows:

1. Create an empty 2D array of the same size as the input.
2. Iterate over each element in the input array.
3. For each element, copy it to the corresponding position in the output array.
4. Continue until all elements have been copied.

This transformation preserves the structure of the input array and simply creates a new array with the same elements.
