The transformation seems to be quite simple:

1. Find the first occurrence of the letter "i" in the input matrix.
2. Replace all occurrences of the letter "i" with the letter "g".
3. Find the first occurrence of the letter "g" in the modified matrix.
4. Replace all occurrences of the letter "g" with the letter "h".
5. Return the modified matrix.

However, after analyzing the last input example, you realize that the transformation does not work as expected. Can you figure out what is wrong with the transformation and how to fix it?

The transformation is a sliding window of size 3x3 that moves from left to right and top to bottom. The window replaces the central cell with the maximum value of the 3x3 window.

The transformation is applied to each element in the 2D array independently.

The transformation is applied to the input array input3 as follows:

For the first row:
- The window starts at position [0,0] and the maximum value is a.
- The window moves to position [1,0] and the maximum value is e.
- The window moves to position [2,0] and the maximum value is e.
- The window moves to position [3,0] and the maximum value is f.
- The window moves to position [4,0] and the maximum value is i.

For the second row:
- The window starts at position [0,1] and the maximum value is e.
- The window moves to position [1,1] and the maximum value is e.
- The window moves to position [2,1] and the maximum value is e.
- The window moves to position [3,1] and the maximum value is f.

The transformation is not a simple one, but you are confident that you have deduced it correctly.

In this problem, you are given a 2D board with a 3x3 grid. Your task is to find the corresponding output for a given input board. The input and output boards are represented as 2D lists of characters.

The transformation rules are as follows:

If the bottom row of the input board contains at least two 'c' characters, the output board will have 'b' in the bottom row.
If the bottom row of the input board contains exactly one 'c' character, the output board will have 'h' in the bottom row.
If the bottom row of the input board contains no 'c' characters, the output board will be the same as the input board.

Note: The input board will always have at least one 'c' character in the bottom row.

To find the answer, you can follow these simple steps:

1. Check the bottom row of the input board.
2. If it contains at least two 'c' characters, set the bottom row of the output board to 'b'.
3. If it contains exactly one 'c' character, set the bottom row of the output board to 'h'.
4. If it contains no 'c' characters, set the output board to be the same as the input board.

Using these steps, you can find the corresponding output for any given input board.

[[e,a,a],

The transformation seems to be quite simple:

1. Keep the first row and first column unchanged.
2. Replace all other elements with the element from the corresponding position in the first row or first column, whichever is closer.

This transformation can be implemented in O(1) time complexity, as it only requires accessing elements from the input matrix and does not require any additional computation.

Therefore, the corresponding output for the last input example is:

output3: 3x3

Now you are given the following input:
input4: 3x3
[[a,b,c],
[d,e,f],
[g,h,i]]

You are supposed to find the corresponding output.

Given the previous examples, it seems that the transformation is a rotation of 180 degrees around the center of the board.

Therefore, the corresponding output would be:

The transformation is a bit complex, but you've deduced that it works by expanding the input matrix in a specific way. The first row and first column of the output matrix are copied directly from the input matrix. Then, the remaining elements of the output matrix are filled in by repeating the input matrix in a checkerboard pattern.

In other words, the elements of the output matrix can be calculated as follows:

- For i = 0 to 2:
  - For j = 0 to 2:
    - output[i][j] = input[i/2][j/2]
- For i = 3 to 5:
  - For j = 0 to 2:
    - output[i][j] = input[(i-3)/2][j/2]
- For i = 3 to 5:
  - For j = 3 to 5:
    - output[i][j] = input[(i-3)/2][(j-3)/2]

Using this logic, you can deduce the corresponding output for any given input matrix.

The transformation is a sliding window of size 2x2 that slides over the input matrix and expands it horizontally and vertically by duplicating the elements in the window. The elements outside the window are filled with the corresponding elements from the input matrix.

To deduce the corresponding output for the given input, we can use the same transformation.

You are correct! The transformation is indeed a 2D sliding window that slides over the input board and extracts a 3x3 sub-board. The extracted sub-board is then analyzed to determine the number of occurrences of a specific cell value (in this case, 'a'). If this count is greater than or equal to 2, the corresponding cell in the output board is set to 'f', otherwise it is set to 'a'.

Well done! You have successfully deduced the transformation and solved the problem.

The transformation seems to be:

2. Replace all occurrences of "e" with "a".


Am I correct?


Yes, you are correct! The transformation you described is indeed the one that was applied to the input boards to generate the output boards.


In each case, the output board is obtained from the input board by replacing all occurrences of the letter "d" with the letter "a", and then replacing all occurrences of the letter "e" with the letter "a".

Now you are confident that you have deduced the correct transformation for the given 2D board input/output pairs.

The transformation seems to be:

1. Find all the connected components in the input board.
2. For each connected component, count the number of 'a' cells.
3. If the count is odd, remove one 'a' cell from the component.
4. If the count is even, remove two 'a' cells from the component.
5. Repeat steps 3-4 until no more 'a' cells can be removed.
6. The output board is the resulting board after all the 'a' cells have been removed.
