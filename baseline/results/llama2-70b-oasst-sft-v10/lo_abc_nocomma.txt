output: 3x3
[[aaa],
[caa],
[caa]]


The transformation seems to be rearranging the elements in the matrix in a specific way. To find the pattern, let's consider the first two inputs and outputs:

input0: 3x3
[[bbb],
[aaa],
[aaa]]

output0: 3x3
[[aaa],
[bbb],
[aaa]]

input1: 3x3
[[aaa],
[bbb],
[aaa]]

output1: 3x3
[[aaa],
[aaa],
[bbb]]


We can see that the transformation moves the elements in the matrix from the top row to the bottom row, and from the left column to the right column. This can be described as a combination of a rotation and a reflection. Specifically, the transformation can be defined as follows:

1. Rotate the matrix 180 degrees.
2. Reflect the matrix across the diagonal.

Let's apply this transformation to the last input example:

input5: 3x3
[[caa],
[caa],
[aaa]]

1. Rotate the matrix 180 degrees:
[[aaa],
[caa],
[caa]]

2. Reflect the matrix across the diagonal:
[[caa],
[caa],
[aaa]]


Therefore, the output for input5 should be:

output5: 3x3
[[caa],
[caa],
[aaa]]
expected: 3x3
[[aaa],
[caa],
[caa]]

The transformation seems to be quite simple. It takes a 10x10 board and returns a 2x2 board. The elements in the output board are the most common element in the corresponding row/column of the input board.

For example, in the first input/output pair:

- The most common element in the first row is 'a'.
- The most common element in the second row is 'a'.
- The most common element in the first column is 'i'.
- The most common element in the second column is 'i'.

Therefore, the output is [[ii], [ii]].

Using this logic, we can deduce the output for the last input example:

input4: 10x10
[[dddddajjjj],
[daaadajaaj],
[daaadajaaj],
[daaadajaaj],
[daaadajaaj],
[daaadajaaj],
[daaadajaaj],
[daaadajaaj],
[dddddajaaj],
[aaaaaajjjj]]

To find the most common element in each row/column, we can use the following Python code:

```python
from collections import Counter

def most_common_element(board):
    rows = [Counter(row) for row in board]
    cols = [Counter(zip(*board))[j] for j in range(10)]
    return [[rows[j][cols[j]] for j in range(2)],
            [cols[j][rows[j][cols[j]]] for j in range(2)]]

input4 = [[dddddajjjj],

You are correct. The transformation is a bitwise XOR operation on the corresponding elements of the two input matrices. The output matrix is the result of applying the XOR operation to the corresponding elements of the two input matrices. In this case, the two input matrices are [[cac], [ccc], [cac]] and [[b]], so the output matrix is [[b]].

The transformation is a 2D reflection about the central axis of the input matrix.

In order to come up with the answer, I first observed the pattern in the given input/output pairs. I noticed that the transformation being applied to the input matrix is a reflection about its central axis. This means that the central row and column of the input matrix remain unchanged, while the other rows and columns are reflected around them.

To deduce the corresponding output for the last input example, I applied the same transformation to the input matrix:

input5: 3x4
[[eejj],
[eeee],
[eejj]]

Reflecting the outer rows and columns around the central axis, we get:

output5: 6x4
[[eejj],
[eeee],
[eejj],
[eejj],
[eeee],
[eejj]]

Therefore, the output for the given input is [[eejj], [eeee], [eejj], [eejj], [eeee], [eejj]].
expected: 6x4

Can you explain the logic behind the transformation?

The transformation appears to be replacing each element in the input matrix with the maximum value of the corresponding row or column. For example, in the first input matrix, the maximum value in the first row is 3, so the first row in the output matrix is [3, 3, 3]. Similarly, the maximum value in the first column is 3, so the first column in the output matrix is [3, 3, 3]. The same process is repeated for the other rows and columns.

In the last input matrix, the maximum value in the first row is 3, so the first row in the output matrix is [3, 3, 3]. The maximum value in the first column is also 3, so the first column in the output matrix is [3, 3, 3]. The maximum value in the second row is 3, so the second row in the output matrix is [3, 3, 3]. The maximum value in the second column is 3, so the second column in the output matrix is [3, 3, 3]. Finally, the maximum value in the third row is 3, so the third row in the output matrix is [3, 3, 3]. Putting it all together, we get the output matrix [[iii], [iii], [iii]].

The transformation is a 3x3 sliding window that moves horizontally across the input board, taking the central 3x3 sub-board and outputting it.

The transformation can be described as follows:

1. Initialize an empty 3x3 output board.
2. Starting from the top-left corner of the input board, move horizontally to the right, considering each 3x3 sub-board in turn.
3. For each 3x3 sub-board, copy the central 3x3 sub-board to the output board.
4. Continue moving horizontally to the right until the end of the input board is reached.
5. Return the output board.

Using this transformation, you can now deduce the corresponding output for any given input board.

The transformation is a sliding window of size 3x3 that shifts one position at a time. The window replaces the center element with the average of the 9 elements in the window, and replaces the other 8 elements with the value 'i' if they are equal to the center element, or 'a' if they are not.

The transformation is applied repeatedly until the entire board is transformed.

In the given example, the transformation is applied as follows:

1. The first 3x3 window is at the top left corner, and its center element is 'a'. The window replaces the center element with the average of the 9 elements (which is 'a'), replaces the other 8 elements with 'i' since they are all equal to 'a', and the resulting window is [[iii], [iaa], [iii]].

2. The window shifts one position to the right, and its center element is still 'a'. The window replaces the center element with the average of the 9 elements (which is 'a'), replaces the other 8 elements with 'i' since they are all equal to 'a', and the resulting window is [[iii], [iaa], [iii]].

3. The window shifts one position down, and its center element is 'a'. The window replaces the center element with the average of the 9 elements (which is 'a'), replaces the other 8 elements with 'i' since they are all equal to 'a', and the resulting window is [[iii], [iaa], [iii]].

You are correct! The transformation is called "concatenation along the main diagonal". The idea is to take the input matrix and create a new matrix by concatenating the corresponding elements along the main diagonal. For example, in the first input/output pair, the element at position (0,0) in the input matrix is "a" and the element at position (0,0) in the output matrix is "afa". The element at position (0,1) in the input matrix is "f" and the element at position (0,1) in the output matrix is "fa". We continue this process until we reach the bottom-right corner of the input matrix. At this point, we have filled in the top-left corner of the output matrix. We then repeat this process, starting from the next element along the main diagonal in the input matrix, until we have filled in the entire output matrix.

In general, if the input matrix is n x m and the output matrix is 2n x 2m, then the transformation can be described as follows:

for i = 0 to n-1 do
  for j = 0 to m-1 do
    output[i][2j] = input[i][j]
    output[i][2j+1] = input[i+1][j]
  end for
end for

where input and output are the input and output matrices, respectively, and n and m are the dimensions of the input matrix.

output: 3x3
[[afa],
[fff],
[afa]]

The transformation is a 2D sliding window that moves over the input matrix and extracts a 3x3 submatrix. The submatrix is then rotated 180 degrees and returned as the output.

For example, in the first input/output pair:

input: 5x5
[[caaaa],
[acaac],
[caaca],
[aaacc],
[aacca]]

The first 3x3 submatrix is [[caaaa], [acaac], [caaca]]. After rotating it 180 degrees, we get [[fff], [afa], [afa]]. This is the output for the first input.

Similarly, for the second input:

input: 5x5
[[aaaaa],
[aabbb],
[ababb],
[ababa],
[aaaab]]

The first 3x3 submatrix is [[aaaaa], [aabbb], [ababb]]. After rotating it 180 degrees, we get [[afa], [fff], [afa]]. This is the output for the second input.

And so on.

For the last input:

input: 5x5
[[bbbba],
[aabab],
[abaaa],
[abaab],
[aabaa]]

The first 3x3 submatrix is [[bbbba], [aabab], [abaaa]]. After rotating it 180 degrees, we get [[afa], [fff], [afa]]. This is the output for the last input.

So the answer is:

output8: 3x3

You are now confident that you have deduced the correct transformation for the given input/output pairs.

Part #1: Identify the input board size.
Usage: input5: 9x10. The input board size is 9x10, which means the board has 9 rows and 10 columns.

Part #2: Identify the input board contents.
Usage: input5: [[aafaaafaaa], [aafaaaffaa], [aaffaaafaa], [aaafaaaffa], [afffaaaafa], [afaaaafffa], [afaaaafaaa], [affaaffaaa], [aafaafaaaa]]. These are the contents of the input board, with each element representing a cell in the board.

Part #3: Identify the corresponding output board size.
Usage: output5: 3x1. The output board size is 3x1, which means the board has 3 rows and 1 column.

Part #4: Identify the corresponding output board contents.
Usage: output5: [[a], [a], [a]]. These are the contents of the output board, with each element representing a cell in the board. In this case, all cells have the value 'a'.
