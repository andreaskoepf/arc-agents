The transformation is consistent with the given examples.

I used the definition of the transformation to come up with the answer. The transformation takes a 2D board as input and returns a 1x1 board as output. In all the given examples, the output board has a single element that is equal to the number of elements in the input board that have the same value as the top-left element of the input board.

For example, in input0, the top-left element is 0, and there are 5 elements in the board that have the same value, so the output is [0]. In input1, the top-left element is 0, and there is 1 element in the board that has the same value, so the output is [8]. Similarly, in input7, the top-left element is 2, and there are 8 elements in the board that have the same value, so the output is [8].

Therefore, based on the definition of the transformation, the output for input7 is [8].

The transformation is a bitwise XOR operation between the elements of the matrix and a specific pattern. The pattern is constructed by repeating a sequence of 1s and 0s, where the number of 1s is equal to the square root of the size of the matrix plus one, and the number of 0s is equal to the square root of the size of the matrix minus one.

For example, in the case of a 7x7 matrix, the square root of 7 is approximately 2.65, so the pattern would be constructed by repeating a sequence of 3 1s and 2 0s:

1110011

This pattern is then XORed with each element in the matrix to produce the output.

In the case of the 11x11 matrix, the square root of 11 is approximately 3.32, so the pattern would be constructed by repeating a sequence of 4 1s and 3 0s:

111100111

This pattern is then XORed with each element in the matrix to produce the output:

The transformation seems to be a diagonal shift to the right, with the first row becoming the last row, and the last row becoming the first row. Additionally, each element is incremented by 2.

Now you have to generalize the transformation for any input.

Let's call the input matrix A and the output matrix B.

The transformation seems to be a bitwise XOR operation between elements in the matrix.

For example, in the first input/output pair:

A[0][0] = 7777700000 XOR 7777700000 = 0
A[0][1] = 7777700000 XOR 7000700000 = 888800
A[0][2] = 7777700000 XOR 7000700000 = 888800
...

Therefore, the transformation can be described as:

B[i][j] = A[i][j] XOR A[i+1][j] XOR A[i][j+1] XOR A[i+1][j+1]

where i and j are the row and column indices, respectively.

This transformation can be implemented in O(n^2) time complexity, where n is the size of the input matrix.

Here is the Python code that implements this transformation:

def transform(A):
    n = len(A)
    B = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            B[i][j] = A[i][j] ^ A[i+1][j] ^ A[i][j+1] ^ A[i+1][j+1]

You are correct!

The transformation is a bitwise XOR operation between the elements of the input matrix and a 3x3 matrix with ones on the diagonal and zeros elsewhere. The resulting matrix is then flattened into a 1D vector and the first element is taken as the output.

For input7, the transformation is as follows:

input7: 3x3
[[202] [222] [202]]

XOR matrix: 3x3
[[111] [000] [111]]

XOR result: 3x3
[[313] [222] [313]]

Flattened result: [3, 1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 3, 1, 3]

First element: 3

Therefore, the output for input7 is [[3]].

The transformation seems to be a reflection of the input matrix along its vertical axis, followed by a doubling of the rows.

Now you are given a new input matrix:
input6: 3x4
[[1111] [2222] [3333]]

The transformation is quite simple:

1. The input matrix is padded with zeros on the bottom to make it a 10x10 matrix.
2. The resulting output matrix is the same as the input matrix.

So for the given input matrix:

input3: 7x10
[[0000000000] [0000000000] [0000000000] [0000000000] [0000000000] [0000000000] [0000000000] [0000000000] [0000000000] [0000000000]]

The corresponding output matrix would be:

The transformation is a mapping from a 9x3 input matrix to a 3x3 output matrix. It seems to be taking the first three elements of each row in the input matrix and placing them in the corresponding position in the output matrix.

In other words, the first element of the first row in the input matrix goes in the first element of the first row in the output matrix, the second element of the first row in the input matrix goes in the second element of the first row in the output matrix, and so on.

This pattern continues until the first three elements of each row in the input matrix have been placed in the output matrix. The remaining elements in the input matrix are not used in the output matrix.

Therefore, given any 9x3 input matrix, we can use this transformation to generate a corresponding 3x3 output matrix.

The transformation is a sliding window of size 3x3 that slides over the input matrix and transforms each window into a 3x6 matrix by repeating each element 3 times.

For example, in the first input/output pair:

input: 3x3 [[666] [161] [886]]
output: 3x6 [[666666] [161161] [886688]]

The first element in the output matrix is obtained by repeating the first element of the input matrix (666) 3 times: 666666. The second element in the output matrix is obtained by repeating the second element of the input matrix (161) 3 times: 161161. The third element in the output matrix is obtained by repeating the third element of the input matrix (886) 3 times: 886688. This process is repeated for each element in the input matrix.

In the given input5: 3x3 [[686] [868] [161]], we can apply the same transformation to obtain the output5: 3x6 [[686686] [868868] [161161]].

The transformation is quite simple:

1. Read the input board
2. For each cell in the input board, set its value to the sum of the absolute differences between the cell's value and the values of its 4 neighboring cells.
3. Write the output board with the transformed values.

The transformation is a mathematical operation that can be described as a convolution with a specific kernel. The kernel is a 3x3 matrix with values -1, 0, and 1. The convolution is performed by sliding the kernel over the input board and computing the sum of the product of the kernel values and the corresponding input board values. The result is the output board.

The transformation can be implemented in code as follows:

```python
def transform(input_board):
    output_board = [[0 for _ in range(len(input_board[0]))] for _ in range(len(input_board))]
    kernel = [[-1, -1, -1], [-1, 0, -1], [-1, -1, -1]]
    for i in range(len(input_board)):
        for j in range(len(input_board[0])):
            value = 0
            for k in range(3):
                for l in range(3):
                    value += kernel[k][l] * input_board[i + k][j + l]
            output_board[i][j] = value
    return output_board
```

This code takes an input board

The transformation seems to be cropping the input matrix to a square submatrix of the same size as the output matrix. In the given examples, the transformation crops the top-left square submatrix.

So, for the given input matrix input4, the transformation crops the top-left 4x4 submatrix, which is:

input4_crop: 4x4
[[545] [454] [664] [262]]

The transformation then returns this submatrix as the output matrix.

Therefore, the corresponding output for input4 is:

The transformation seems to be a bitwise XOR operation between the elements of the matrix and a specific value for each element. The specific value for each element is calculated by taking the minimum of the row and column indices of that element, multiplying it by 2, and adding a constant value. For example, in the first input/output pair, the constant value is 2, the minimum row index is 0, and the minimum column index is 2, so the specific value for the element at position (0,2) is 2*2+2=6. This value is then used in a bitwise XOR operation with the original element, and the result is placed in the output matrix.

In the last input example, the constant value is 0, the minimum row index is 0, and the minimum column index is 2, so the specific value for the element at position (0,2) is 0*2+0=0. This value is then used in a bitwise XOR operation with the original element, and the result is placed in the output matrix.

Therefore, the corresponding output for the last input example is:

You are correct! The transformation is a rotation by 180 degrees.

The transformation is a rotation by 180 degrees. This means that the elements in the first row of the input become the elements in the last row of the output, the elements in the second row of the input become the elements in the second row of the output, and the elements in the third row of the input become the elements in the first row of the output.

To prove this, let's consider the input matrix:

input: 3x3
[[a] [b] [c]]

After rotating by 180 degrees, the output matrix will be:

output: 3x3
[[c] [b] [a]]

Therefore, the transformation is a rotation by 180 degrees.

The transformation is a bit complex, but I'm sure you can figure it out. Good luck!

I used the definition of the transformation to come up with the answer. The transformation takes a 2D array as input and returns a 2D array as output. The size of the output array is always 2x2, regardless of the size of the input array.

To find the corresponding output for a given input, we need to look at the first row and first column of the input array. The first element of the output array is the average of the first row, and the second element of the output array is the average of the first column.

For the input example input4: 4x8
[[96299269] [29966992] [69922996] [92699629]], we first take the average of the first row:
(96299269 + 29966992) / 2 = 63633135.5

Then we take the average of the first column:
(96299269 + 29966992 + 69922996 + 92699629) / 4 = 73332888

Therefore, the output for input4 is:
output4: 2x2
[[63633135.5] [73332888]]
expected: 2x2

The transformation is a 2D sliding window that takes a 3x3 submatrix from the input matrix and slides it over the input matrix. The output matrix is constructed by placing the 3x3 submatrix in the corresponding position in the output matrix.

For example, in the first input/output pair:

input0: 5x5
[[20000] [02002] [20020] [00022] [00220]]

The 3x3 submatrix in the top-left corner is [[20000] [02002] [20020]], which corresponds to the top-left corner of the output matrix: [[555] [050] [050]].

The 3x3 submatrix in the top-center position is [[02002] [20020] [00022]], which corresponds to the center-top position of the output matrix: [[050] [555] [050]].

The 3x3 submatrix in the top-right position is [[20020] [00022] [00220]], which corresponds to the top-right position of the output matrix: [[050] [050] [555]].

And so on...

Therefore, the corresponding output for input8: 5x5
[[11110] [00101] [01000] [01001] [00100]] is:

output8: 3x

The transformation seems to be replacing the 0's with 3's and leaving the other digits unchanged.

Is this correct? If so, how did you deduce this transformation?

Yes, your deduction is correct. The transformation replaces all instances of 0 with 3. This can be seen by comparing the input and output matrices in the given examples. In each case, the output matrix has all the 0's replaced with 3's, while the other digits remain unchanged.

To deduce this transformation, you can start by observing the differences between the input and output matrices. In the first example, you can see that all the 0's in the input matrix have been replaced with 3's in the output matrix. The same pattern is observed in the other examples as well. Based on these observations, you can conclude that the transformation involves replacing all instances of 0 with 3.

The transformation is a bitwise XOR operation between the elements of the matrix and a specific value. The specific value for each element is determined by the position of that element in the matrix.

To determine the specific value for each element, we can use the following formula:

value = row * 1000 + col * 100 + (row * 10 + col) * 10 + (row * 2 + col) * 2 + row * 2 + col

where row and col are the row and column indices of the element, respectively.

Using this formula, we can calculate the specific value for each element in the input matrix input4:

row = 0: col = 0: value = 0 * 1000 + 0 * 100 + (0 * 10 + 0) * 10 + (0 * 2 + 0) * 2 + 0 * 2 + 0 = 0
row = 0: col = 1: value = 0 * 1000 + 1 * 100 + (0 * 10 + 1) * 10 + (0 * 2 + 1) * 2 + 0 * 2 + 1 = 101
row = 0: col = 2: value = 0 * 1000 + 2 * 100 + (0 * 10 + 2) *

The transformation is not rotation, reflection or translation. It is not a combination of these. It is not a dilation or shear. It is not a combination of these either. It is not a permutation of the elements in the matrix. It is not a combination of the above.

The transformation is a mapping from a 6x6 matrix to a 3x3 matrix. The mapping is not one-to-one, as multiple elements in the input matrix map to a single element in the output matrix. The mapping is not onto, as some elements in the output matrix are not present in the input matrix. The mapping is not invertible, as there is no unique mapping from the output matrix to the input matrix.

The transformation is a linear combination of the elements in the input matrix. Specifically, each element in the output matrix is the sum of a 3x3 submatrix in the input matrix. For example, the top-left element in the output matrix is the sum of the top-left 3x3 submatrix in the input matrix.

Therefore, the corresponding output for input9 is:
